        The first job I ever held was with Hewlett Packard(HP). At 
        that time, I had no interest in anything dealing with computers.
        I was a college student with a Biology major, looking forward to 
        becoming a Nurse. As time progressed, I realized that Nursing wasn't 
        exactly for me. I took some time to re-evaluate my future. I realized that
        troubleshooting and repairing computers was something that I conquered easily.
        It was then that I attened Virginia College and graduated with a Network Technician 
        Diploma. While in college, I maintained an A average and landed the Presidents List
        and Deans List. I have interned at Sanford University's Brock School of Business.
        There I was introduced to computer programming. At that moment I found my passion
        and my career. In 2020, I became a candidate of Innovate Birmingham computer programming
        bootcamp. There I gained vaulable skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently in search
        of a Software Developer position with an excellent company, where I can utilize my programming skills.
